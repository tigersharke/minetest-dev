This repo is intended to provide the contents of a FreeBSD ports tree leaf: /usr/ports/games/minetest-dev so that those who desire may obtain and build their own.  This will follow the github repo with updates as frequent as I am able, tied to commits there.  My commits to be ONE day behind in order to avoid multiple commits of the same date.

Since this development version of minetest now uses its own fork of irrlicht, those FreeBSD users will also need to obtain https://github.com/tigersharke/irrlicht-minetest for a complete build.  As these two repos do not update at the same time, I choose to keep them seperate and build them when each upstream repo updates.
