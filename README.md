This repo is intended to provide the contents of a ports tree leaf: /usr/ports/games/minetest-dev so that those who desire may obtain and build their own.  This will follow the github repo with updates as frequent as I am able, tied to commits there.

Since this development version of minetest now uses its own fork of irrlicht, those FreeBSD users will also need to obtain https://github.com/tigersharke/irrlicht-minetest for a complete build.
